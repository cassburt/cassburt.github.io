						<span class="cd-funky-fresh">Forty Gavels</span> is the ground-breaking biography  of the American Labor Movement’s longest-serving leader, Reuben G. Soderstrom. As President of the Illinois State Federation of Labor and the Illinois AFL-CIO from 1930-1970, Soderstrom led one of the nation’s largest labor organizations through the most challenging, exciting, and impactful events of the twentieth century. From the horrors and sacrifice of the Great Depression and World War II to the triumphs of post-war recovery, from the great merger of the AFL-CIO and on to the struggles and successes of the Civil Rights Movement, Soderstrom was there, forging a legacy as organized labor’s most prolific voice. Adopting a year-by-year study of these years, this three-volume biography follows him to violent front-line strikes, rowdy union meetings in Chicago and all the way to policy summits at the White House, making <span class="cd-funky">Forty Gavels</span> one of the most detailed studies of the American Labor Movement to date.

						This volume sees Soderstrom elected president of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, a victory quickly complicated by the onset of the Great Depression, which threatens to destroy organized labor with devastating unemployment and the lurking forces of Communism. But Reuben rallies workers across Illinois—one of the nation’s most industrialized states—and holds the ISFL together by sheer will until Roosevelt’s New Deal helps turn the tide. World War II then brings a manufacturing boost powered by extraordinarily productive union men and women, strengthening Reuben’s Federation in Illinois and increasing his influence on the national stage. Soderstrom gains further advances for his growing membership as he successfully navigates the post-war strikes that hurt labor’s standing in the rest of the country. But political setbacks and eventual passage of the Taft-Hartley Act deliver a devastating blow to American unions, forcing Reuben and his Federation to consider new alliances with old foes to find a way forward.
